# How to Ask for Help
### Introduction

When filing a problem report it is never harmful to provide _more_ information than needed, but is _almost always harmful to not provide enough information_.

If your problem report does not provide enough information many people will not bother to even respond as they consider it a waste of time to ask for information which **_should_** have been provided in the original problem report.

Help others to help _you!_

_Try to provide as much information as possible when filing problem reports!_

### Details

  * [Before You Ask](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before):

      *  If you are using a third party product to provide needed Hercules functionality (such as SDL's "[CTCI-WIN](http://www.softdevlabs.com/ctci-win)" product), have you consulted the provided "Help" file that comes with the product? For example, did you perform a multi-directional Ping Test as part of your troubleshooting? If you did, you should probably provide the output in your problem report.


  * [Be precise and informative about your problem](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#beprecise).:

      *  The _specific_ version of Hercules you are using (i.e. the output of the Hercules `version` command).

      *  Your _complete_ Hercules configuration file.

      *  Your _complete_ Hercules log file.

      *  What guest operating system and release level are you running under Hercules? VM? MVS? z/VM? z/OS? Other?

      * Your _complete_ `TCPIP.PROFILE` dataset if your problem is networking related.

      *  Which host operating system platform are you using? (Windows? Linux? Mac?) Which version is it? Windows 7? CentOS 6.8? Is it 32-bit or 64-bit?

      *  Is the problem consistent and repeatable? What procedure can others use to try and re-create your problem?

      *  Is there anything else you can think of that might be related to your problem? Do you have any unusual or related software installed on your host? Have you made any recent configuration changes to your host?

### Closing Remarks

If you provide a quality problem report with the information others need to help you, you will stand a much better chance of actually obtaining the quality help you seek.

**Remember**: the people you are asking are not psychic! They don't know the details of your problem. Only you know that.

If you provide them with the details they _need_ to help you, they might actually be willing and _able_ to help you.

Otherwise you're just wasting their time.
